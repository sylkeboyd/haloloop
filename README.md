# haloloop
Analyse series of TSI data for sky type and ice halo appearances. Assign a skytype score (STS) and ice halo score (IHS) to each image in order to identify periods of ice halo appearances. Objective: cirrus cloud composition, in particular smooth hexagonal crystals.

A description of the code elements, input etc can be found in the word document Haloloop2018-development notes.docx. This document will be updated as the code is changed. Found the coding guidelines too late - will address in fortcoming versions.

Uses opencv3.2. Developed and tested in MinGW environment.
